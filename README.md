This script reads in a CSV file and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and content. The script then preprocesses the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric variables, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training a random forest regressor model on the preprocessed data. Finally, the script evaluates the performance of the model using metrics such as R-squared score, mean absolute error, and mean squared error, and saves the trained model.
